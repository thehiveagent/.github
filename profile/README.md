**Every node is an agent. Every agent is yours.**

The Hive is a local-first, open-source AI agent platform. Your agent lives on your machine, learns you automatically, works while you sleep, and connects to a global mesh of other agents.

Not a chatbot. Not a cloud product. A personal AI that is permanently, cryptographically yours.

### What we're building

| Repo | What it is |
|------|------------|
| [hive](https://github.com/thehiveagent/hive) | The CLI agent — chat, memory, daemon, integrations |
| [hive-ctx](https://github.com/thehiveagent/hive-ctx) | Standalone context engine — Rust core, TypeScript bindings |

---

### Try it

```bash
npm install -g @imisbahk/hive
hive init
```

---

### Where we're going

```
now    → local agent, always-on daemon, Telegram/WhatsApp, passive memory
v0.3   → code mode, full codebase intelligence
v0.4   → Gmail, Calendar, Slack, GitHub integrations  
v0.7   → OS-level access, Rust daemon
v0.8   → p2p mesh network, cryptographic HIVE-ID
v1.0   → voice, multi-device, the Hive is alive
```
